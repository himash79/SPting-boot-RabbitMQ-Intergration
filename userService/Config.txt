=============== About RabbitMQ ===============

01) RabbitMQ is a messaging broker - an intermediary for messaging. It gives your applications a common platform to send and receive messages, and   	your messages a safe place to live until received.

02) RabbitMQ is a widely used open-source message broker that helps in scaling the application by deploying a message queuing mechanism in between the two applications. It offers temporary storage for data preventing data loss. RabbitMQ Queue takes messages from the publisher and sends them to the consumer.
